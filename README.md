# Furry Game - Simple game in JS. 

Its a small exercise to repeat: object, method, constructor, etc. :)

**Furry** is a hero of game, who can move on field 10x10. To move, we have to use the arrows.
During the game, we have to catch **Coins** and avoid the edges of the board.
We have counter, to check who is better :)

## Built of ...

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/CSS)
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/HTML)

## Further idea for development

I will add more CSS animations and sounds, for better look. For example, chose 'theme' hero of game before started, etc.
Add Database for savings scores. 
More mechanizm for JS, like: shorter response time at a higher level, a decreasing field with time.
