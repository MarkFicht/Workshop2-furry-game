# Furry Game - Simple game in JS. 

[DEMO here](https://markficht.github.io/Workshop2-furry-game/)

This project is my repetition of the material: 
- objects, methods, constructors, webpack cli, etc. :)

**Furry** is a hero of game, who can move on field 10x10. To move, we have to use the arrows.
During the game, we have to catch **Coins** and avoid the edges of the board.
We have counter, to check who is better :)

## Installation and configuration

You need nothing install, to play the game. You can open this project in:  `./index.html`

---
If you want to make changes, then must: 
- Install Node.js -> [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Open folder with all files, and open your command prompt.
- Execute the command `npm i` -> webpack and webpack cli is in package.json

I skipped file webpack.config.js - In CLI gives the output file.<br />
If you don't have global installed webpack, execute this command:
- `./node_modules/.bin/webpack app.js --output out.js`

Tested on browsers: `Chrome`, `Opera`.

## Built of ...

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/CSS)
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/HTML)

## Further idea for development

I will add more CSS animations and sounds, for better look. For example, chose 'theme' hero of game before started, etc.
Add Database for savings scores. 
More mechanism for JS, like: shorter response time at a higher level, a decreasing field with time.
